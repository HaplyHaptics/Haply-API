# Haply API Java

## How To Use This Repository
In this repository you'll find a number of examples that work with Processing. To explore the examples, download the correct firmware and load it onto your board. From there, download and run an example in Processing.

The lib and src folders contain files for starting projects without the use of examples; you'll find that these files already appear in the example folders in which they are needed. It is recommended to use the Empty Project Template folder for starting your own project rather than start completely from scratch.

## This API Requires:  
Haply Modular Haptic Development Kit Firmware v0.4 + for Haply Board v0.3, or  
Haply M0 Firmware v0.3 + for Haply M0 v0.3, or  
Haply M3 Firmware v1.5 + for Haply M3 v0.4,  
and is made to work with 2-DOF Haplet

### Haptic Examples (Uses Physics Engine)
- Hello Wall
- Drag n Drop
- Maze
- Shapes

### Empty Project Templates
- Haptic Template (without Physics)
- Haptic Template (with Physics)

### Component Examples
Note: These examples showcase how to use external components with Processing. In order to use these, you'll need to have the external component connected to your board.
- Actuators
- Analog Input
- Encoder
- PWM

## lib
- .jar files containing the Physics Engine components

## src
- .java files to be placed in the same folder as your Processing sketch
